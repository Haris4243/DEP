Weather Forecasting System User Manual

1. Introduction

The Weather Forecasting System is a C++ application that provides current and historical weather data, as well as air quality information, for a given location. The system uses APIs to fetch data from external sources and displays it in a user-friendly format.

2. Setting Up the Application

To set up the application, follow these steps:

Install the required libraries:

jsoncpp for JSON data manipulation

curl for HTTP requests

Compile the code using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++)

Create a configuration file (config.txt) with the following format:
python:
API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY  
API_URL=https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast  
AIR_QUALITY_API_KEY=YOUR_AIR_QUALITY_API_KEY  
AIR_QUALITY_API_URL=https://api.airqualityapi.com/v1/forecast

Replace YOUR_API_KEY and YOUR_AIR_QUALITY_API_KEY with your actual API keys.

3. Running the Application

To run the application, execute the compiled executable file. The application will prompt you to enter a location. Enter a city name or latitude and longitude coordinates, and the application will display the current weather forecast, historical weather data, and air quality information.

4. User Interface

The user interface is a command-line interface that prompts the user to enter a location. Once the location is entered, the application displays the following information:

Current Weather Forecast:
Temperature
Wind Speed
Humidity

Historical Weather Data:
Temperature
Wind Speed
Humidity (for a specified date)

Air Quality:
AQI (Air Quality Index)
PM2.5 (Particulate Matter 2.5)

5. Functionalities

The application provides the following functionalities:

Current Weather Forecast: Displays the current weather forecast for a given location.
Historical Weather Data: Displays historical weather data for a given location and date.
Air Quality: Displays air quality information for a given location.
Export Data: Exports weather forecast and historical weather data to CSV and JSON files.

6. Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while running the application, check the following:

Ensure that the configuration file is correctly formatted and contains valid API keys.
Check the API documentation for any changes to the API endpoints or parameters.
Verify that the required libraries are installed and linked correctly.
